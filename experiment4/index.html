				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, I sought out to create three different tile based world generators,
					utilizing p5.js's tileset systeming to create animated worlds with depth. 
					Images below display possible outputs of the generated worlds presented.<br>
				<img src="./assets/example world 1.PNG" height="30%" width="30%">
				<img src="./assets/example world 2.PNG" height="30%" width="30%">

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
					This generator inserts life into a watery expanse of fishing boats, in the middle 
					of the open ocean. To create a sense of life, fish are spawned across the water, of
					varying sizes and rotation to represent swimming in place. Boats also frequent the 
					scene, bobbing up and down the water.<br>

					This generator inserts life into an open, savannah plains, littered with animated grass,
					which sways in the wind, and trees of various heights.<br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
				This task feels like quite the breath of fresh air! Not because it was any easier than the previous (it wasn't)...
				but because now it truely feels like I am coming into my own in utilizing tools to create meaninful generated
				content. While we accomplished something similar with the previous project, the added usage of depth & the ability to
				shape our own assets allows me to really feel that these worlds are my own. As I am a solo act, i am slightly dismayed I was
				not able to create as intricate assignments as some of the other groups, but I am still hapy & accomplished with what I have
				achieved, and the tools I have now learned!
