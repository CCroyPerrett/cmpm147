				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I set out to create a simple story generator. Through this finished product, one an generate a short & sweet murder mystery
					in a matter of seconds, asking the player if they can utilize the provided information to find a killer. There are near limitless combinations! Can you solve the mystery and claim your reward?
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This generator takes a predefined promt, and randomly inserts words from a hand-created set to build different murder senarios. For axample,
					there is a list for the suspects' names, the victm's name, the murder location, etc. Some lists are utilized several times (to generate a number of
					possible suspects), which does lead to a slight risk of repeat names, so certain lists were extended to a great length to make that less likley. Through 
					utilizing Jquery, a short and consise mystery can be created.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Although I am happy with what I have created so far, this assignmetn only drives me to want to create bigger and better generators. Although what I 
					have created is sufficient, and at times humorous, it is rather restricted in scope. And allthough there isa  solvable mystery (with clues that make sense), a
					majority of the time, occasionally what is presented does not lead to much but dead investigative ends (the randomly selected clues may sometimes not poitn to any of the
					randomly selected suspects).
