				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, I sought out to create two random generators, one to design a dungeon like
					environment, and one to give an impression of a breathing world, utilizing a tiling system./p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
					Above can be seen two example images of my world generator, and the links
					to the generators can be found below. 

					The World design generator is done iterativley, first generating the ground (including darker partches), and then overlaying
					the rivers, houses & trees in random patterns around such. To make the world feel more alive, the grass has an 
					animated effect (which I am quite proud to have discovered how to impliment on accident, while trying to do something else),
					& the houses Light up and darked periodically, to represent the flicker of torchlight. Should the environment have the 
					"snowy tag" selected, than decor on the scene will utilize their snowy counterparts.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This assignment was much more difficult than past attempts. While I could clear the first two in a single day,
					this one took much trail and error & introspection. The p5 system as so many different quirks I am not usedto compared
					to regular javascript, it was rather frustrating for an event to not occur after much trail and effor. regardless, 
					I am proud of my world, woom 7 hallway generator and look forwards to furthuring my experince in this field.
