				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I set out to create a randomly generated scene, reminiscent to viewing the vast cosmos in the distant reaches
					of space. This is meant to be my first foray into the creation of randomly generated scenes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Firstly, the background & stars are generated. To avoid unappealing clumping of the stars, there is a chance for 1 star to spawn
					in somewhere within any segment of the screen, seperated into 20/20 squares from the scene view. Secondly, a number of planets are generated,
					although the number and colors are predetermined, their size & positioning are randomly generated (with a sine floating mechanic)
					to allow it to appear "floating". The comets are then drawn, each one giving a "starting position" and moving downwards diagonally from there,
					returning after a period of time. Finally, the ground layers are geneated in a manner similar to the mountains in the example.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Although it was said that this assignment would be easier than the previous, I did not find this to be the case. While the old assignment 
					was a simple text generator, this one required quite a bit of trial and error to set the generation and movement as it should be. particularly, the comets
				(the fastest form of movement), were particularly vexing, as they tended to deform over time due to a bug on my part, which has now
					been fixed.</p>
